A small python script I wrote to sort my documents files by year. Nothing too fancy, drop it into a folder and run it with the python interpreter. It will sort documents by year from 2010-2013. Going to clean it up over the next few days.


UPDATE 3/17: The program now autobuilds a list of years and then checks the file against those years. Will make this more useful in the future.
